=head1 NAME

tpm - Tiny password manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tpm> [ I<COMMAND> ] [ I<ENTRY> ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

tpm is a tiny shell script which is heavily inspired by pass(1) and uses
gpg2(1) to securely store your passwords. Invoking tpm consists of
specifying a command, either I<insert> or I<show>, and supplying one
entry as a target.

If I<insert> is specified as a command tpm will create a new entry and
read the corresponding password from STDIN. If you specify I<show> as a
command tpm will print the password of the corresponding entry to
STDOUT.
